                    A sliding scale is a tool I use to make this work accessible to people from a variety of experiences. Sliding scales are based on individual income levels, with people of higher incomes paying more. I ask that you are honest about your ability to pay, and that you donâ€™t stress too much about the fee.

                    Fees range between $50 - $80 per 50 min session. I have a limited number of slots available at a lower rate. I accept cash, Venmo, PayPal and personal checks.</div>
