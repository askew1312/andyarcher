                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">While I do not accept insurance, I offer my services on a sliding scale basis. 
                    <br>
                    A sliding scale is a tool I use to make this work accessible to people from a variety of experiences. Sliding scales are based on individual income levels, with people of higher incomes paying more. I ask that you are honest about your ability to pay, and that you don’t stress too much about the fee.
                    <br>
                    Fees range between $50 - $80 per 50 min session. I have a limited number of slots available at a lower rate. I accept cash, Venmo, PayPal and personal checks.</h3>
